Not possible with only using JS, HTML and CSS:
- Using a real database instead of just browser storage
  - Checking and handling form data on the server
  - Letting users log in and manage accounts (optional)
  - Syncing data in real time for everyone (available animals)
  - Keeping sensitive info safe and secure (personal details of partners)

These things need a backend, not just HTML, CSS, or browser JavaScript.
